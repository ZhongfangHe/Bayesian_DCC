# Bayesian Dynamic Correlation Models
MCMC estimation of a number of dynamic correlation models.
Three existing models: DCC (Engle 2002), VC (Tse and Tsui 2002), cDCC (Aielli 2013).
Four versions of the proposed new model: GDC, top-integrated GDC (TIGDC), bottom-integrated GDC (BIGDC), both-integrated GDC (IGDC).
